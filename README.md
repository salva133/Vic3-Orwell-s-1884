# Orwell's 1884
 
'Orwell's 1884' is an alternate history mod for Victoria 3 that places the world in a dystopian reality where the Great Revolution of Socialism in the late 19th century led to rapid and transformative success. In this alternate timeline, three dominant power blocs - Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia - have emerged, each representing a unique interpretation of socialism and spreading ruthlessly throughout their respective spheres. Oceania, a super-state entity encompassing the Americas, moulds its citizens with the principles of IngSoc, an extreme form of authoritarian socialism. Eurasia, covering most of Europe and Russia, follows a neo-Bolshevik ideology characterised by a centralised, collectivist form of government. East Asia, consisting of the countries of East and Southeast Asia, bases its rule on the principle of 'self-sacrifice', an extreme form of collectivism that denies individual identity and freedoms in favour of state goals. 'Orwell's 1884' transports players to a world where the Great Revolution has radically changed the global political landscape. Players can control the destiny of one of these superpowers or stand against their supremacy to shape an alternative future. The mod presents players with the challenge of leading a nation in a world characterised by ideological conflict, expansionism and the constant struggle for power and influence.
