  OCE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Oceania, a vast superstate stretching across the Americas, is a land of strict control and unyielding authority. Governed by the principles of IngSoc, Oceania's society is a testament to the power of the state over the individual, where surveillance and propaganda are tools of governance."
  ASO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Airstrip One, formerly known as Great Britain, stands as the core of Oceania's power in the European theater. It is a land where the past is rewritten, and the present is under the ever-watchful eye of Big Brother."
  EUR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Eurasia, a colossal landmass spanning from Europe's heartlands to the vast expanses of Russia, embodies the raw power of Neo-Bolshevism. This superstate is a fortress of socialist unity, where collective will and iron-clad discipline reign supreme. Governed with an unyielding grip, Eurasia's society is structured around the principles of communal ownership and centralized control. Its citizens, molded by a stringent ideology, contribute tirelessly to the state's relentless pursuit of expansion and the propagation of its revolutionary ideals. In Eurasia, the past is a malleable memory, constantly reshaped to fuel the relentless drive of the present."
  EAS_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Eastasia, the enigmatic superstate, encompasses the vast territories of East and Southeast Asia. This realm is governed by the doctrine of 'Obliteration of Self,' a radical philosophy demanding complete subjugation of individual identity to the collective. The people, bound by an unwavering collective consciousness, function as cogs in a colossal machine geared towards perpetual growth and dominance. Eastasia's culture is marked by a fierce devotion to the state and a relentless ambition to spread its revolutionary vision. Here, the concept of self is dissolved in the crucible of collective purpose, creating a society where the state's ambitions are the only reality that matters."
