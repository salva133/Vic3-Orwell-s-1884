 unified_leadership_pact_desc: "Unified Leadership represents a unique diplomatic pact defining the intricate relationship between superstates and their client states. Under this system, the sovereignty of client states is heavily influenced, if not entirely subsumed, by their overlord superstate. The leader of a client state is replaced by the leader of the overlord, symbolizing a complete integration of political and ideological command. This arrangement ensures that the client state aligns perfectly with the overlord's policies, goals, and global strategy. It reflects a reality where smaller states are not just allies, but extensions of the superstate's will, echoing their master's voice in every aspect of governance. Unified Leadership is a testament to the overwhelming influence and control exercised by the superstates over their spheres of influence, further blurring the lines between individual national identities and the overarching ideology of the superstate."
